# Multi-Cloud
![Alt text](images/MultiCloud.png?raw=true "Multi-Cloud Architecture")

Goal
----
My goal for this project is to architect and build an image upload and recognition process using no less than three different cloud providers.  At the time of writing I have chosen AWS and Azuere as two of the three providers.  The final provider will be either GCP, IBM Cloud, Alibaba or Oracle Cloud.

Expected Outcome
----------------
The outcome I hope to achieve from this project is to gain practical hands-on experience with cloud providers with whom I don't not normally work.

Completion Date
---------------
I expect to have this project finished by 31 January 2021
